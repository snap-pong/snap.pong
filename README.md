🏓 Python Ping Pong Game
A simple Ping Pong (Paddle) game built using Python and Pygame.
This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates core game development concepts such as collision detection, movement, scoring, and basic AI.

🎮 Game Features
Two paddles (Player vs AI or Player vs Player)

Smooth ball movement and paddle controls

Collision detection with paddles and walls

Score tracking system

Simple and clean game interface

Runs smoothly on desktop systems

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Pygame library

📦 Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed.

Install Python
Download from:
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Pygame
Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pygame
▶️ How to Run the Game
Clone or download this repository

Navigate to the project folder

Run the Python file

python ping_pong.py
(Replace ping_pong.py with your actual file name if different)

🎯 Controls
Player Controls
W – Move paddle up

S – Move paddle down

(If you implemented two-player mode, mention Arrow keys here)

🧠 Game Logic Overview
The ball moves continuously across the screen

When the ball hits a paddle or wall, it bounces back

Missing the ball gives a point to the opponent

The AI paddle automatically tracks the ball movement

🛠️ Built With
Python 3

Pygame

📦 Installation
1️⃣ Install Python
Download Python from:
👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

2️⃣ Install Pygame
pip install pygame
▶️ How to Run
Clone this repository or download the ZIP

Open a terminal in the project folder

Run the game:

python ping_pong.py
(Rename the file name if yours is different)

🎮 Controls
Key	Action
W	Move paddle up
S	Move paddle down
(AI controls the opposite paddle automatically)

🧠 How It Works
The ball moves continuously across the screen

When it hits a wall or paddle, its direction reverses

If a paddle misses the ball, the opponent scores

The AI paddle follows the ball’s vertical position
